# Network

Different Kinds of Network models are created here. For example the Random Network, Barabasi-Albert Preferential Attach Network (BA Network). Explosive percolation on some of these networks are also present on the code.


# Terminology
1. self jump: in network percolation, cluster size grows in size in each step.
    Usually largest cluster in step (n) is not the largest cluster in step (n+1).
    But sometimes it is, giving us the self jump for the cluster size.
