explosive percolation e ekta link select korlam. oi link er 2 ta node ekta cluster er already member.
 taile cluster size er product = size^2.
 that means if two nodes belong to the same cluster, they have least chance of being selected

1. Seed will be construced in the same process as BA.
2. A new node will come with m degree.
3. One node among the existing node will be chosen randomly.
Say, the chosen node is ith node.
Then m number of nodes among all the neighbors of ith node will be chosen randomly.
and m links will be established for new nodes.
and this process will continue... for all the nodes.
